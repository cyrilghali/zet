# Lessons Learned in 2022

## I failed.

My goal was to create a startup in 2022.
My first reaction when thinking of an idea was to stop at the first hurdle
and think too much. Thinking too much took up too much space at a time
I was doing nothing. I was looking for perfection.

So here are some rules I've followed since then:

* Just do it. Step by step.
* Create. Learn. Measure. Repeat.


## I fell into a hole: personal development.

Do you think Facebook, Google, Tesla CEO's have read How to get Startup Ideas
by Paul Graham ? No.

Do you think successful people are listening Andrew Huberman to optimize their
day ? No.

Successful people are resilient. They are not looking into how to get better,
they just get better by working. End of story.

You can ask yourself.
* “What small step can I take today to make it easier to reach my goal?”
