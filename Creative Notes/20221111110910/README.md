# Lessons Learned in 2022

## I failed.

My goal was to create a startup in 2022.
First mistake: thinking on what idea could work instead of building things and see
if anybody will be interested.
I was building nothing. I was looking for perfection.

So here are some rules I've followed since then:

* Just build. Take baby steps.
* Learn. Measure. Repeat.


## I consume too much.

I spend most of my time consuming videos on how to do things, instead of doing
them.
I'm a man of practice, I should just gets my hands dirty. That's how I learn.
So one gold rule here:

* Experiment, do not ask google every question you have. More fun.
