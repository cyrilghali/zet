## Projects

This is my wishlist of projects I want to build or would like to build


### Open Source iOS app to edit markdown files that are on this git repository

I want to be able to edit markdowns files on github repo as smoothly as it's possible

### LeanPub for Music
I would like to buy digital content without being locked in a service like
Apple Music

### Open source email client on mobile (iOS)
I'm just tired of ds on gmail

### Agnostic Forest with an API
As a user, I would like to use forest anywhere, and not rely on my phone only.
I would also like to have data about how much time I was focus during the day

### Codebook. Jupyter for any language.
Play around with any language, learn and write down your experiments, what
worked annd what didn't

### LanguageTool cli.

I started playing around with LanguageTool. I tried at first to install the 
snapd version, which is only a GUI. The source code allows you to build a jar.
I just want a simple posix compliant binary to do that job.


### Low Code Assistant

Siri, Google, Alexa, they are all stupid. They know how to call your mom, open
spotify and your gps. That's it. It can be hardcoded.

"Hey Jarvis, reboot my computer" --> ssh into machine, and rebooting it. 

### Small MonicaHQ mobile-first.

A Personal CRM. Manage your relationships easily.
Save notes about their favorite activities, gift they would like to receive
where do they work, what's their birthday.
Just own your data so you can play with this data as you like.
