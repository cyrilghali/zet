# What if we restart Agile ? - Arnaud Lemaire

* Agile nowadays is not what it was supposed to be 
* Authors of the Agile Manifest wrote some book about shutting down agile 
    * The Failure of Agile - Andy Hunt
    * The Tragedy of Craftsmanship - Robert C. Martin
    * Time to Kill Agile - D. Thomas
* It became a buzzword, everything was still the same
    * Project Manager called himself Product Owner
    * Ratio Man/Day -> Points converted into Man/Day
    * Product Release every 6 month -> Same thing with sprint of two weeks
* You can't solve X by doing more X. “Let's follow more the scrum guide !”
    * It doesn't work
