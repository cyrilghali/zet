# I’m stuck

For real. I had a vision of my self last month. Now: I don’t.
I do not feel depressed. I feel lost. I do not know what to do next.
I do know who I want to be, but I don’t know if it makes sense, how valuable that will be to achieve that goal.

I know, I have that habit to think before taking action. But I need to find a purpose to achieve things. Be involved or die.

Answer to myself: Just work and stfu
